### MARKET ENVIRONMENT

According to Statista, the global recorded music revenue for 2017 grew 19.3% to $12.8 billion USD. The current revenue for 2019 has already surpassed the expected growth foreseen to happen in 2020 to an estimated $13.3 billion USD.

### TOWB'S TARGET MARKET

The TWB token from TOWB Music using the new paradigm will occupy 70% of the entire global digital market (In 2017, made up of $9 billion USD).


### Copyright Issue

Digital music market with inadequate and inefficient royalty payment system.

Improper royalty payment system with different countries with diverse laws and currencies.

In the current royalty payment system, artists encounter 3 troublesome problems. They are charged a high amount of international transfer fees, no fast and efficient way to get compensated as it has to be authorized through a tiresome process, and the difficulty to determine the exact number of streams on their content.

### Sound Source Issue

The absence of a proper music distribution service and the short supply of music available to individuals and music companies

Difficult environment to use music commercially due to extensive copyright issues and high fees from agencies

Unlike in the past, due to the convergence of information and communication technology (ICT) media channels have been diversified and making it easier for both companies and individuals to create content. This has lowered barriers into the game, advertising, and media markets very low. Integrating and utilizing music sources is an essential element of the media market.

However, with the copyright problems and high fees from agencies, it is difficult to directly produce new music even though the supply of commercial music is insufficient.

## TOWB'S SOLUTION

### NEW PAYMENT SYSTEM BY TWB

The new system will allow artists’ to have their royalty using the TWB token sent directly to the artists’ TOWB Wallet. Worldwide, where ever you are the easy, fast, and transparent reward payment system.

The TWB token solves the imbalance of the current royalty payment system that was unable to evolve in response to the changing environment of the global digital music market. TOWB's ecosystem will improve artists’ rights by applying the Smart Contract and DRM system based on the blockchain technology, and will present a new paradigm to the royalty payment system.

In addition, a faster and unrestricted availability of TWB globally will make it easier and more efficient to reward. It will be easier to reward for events and services as well as strengthening the relationship between artists and users in the platform. This will also contribute to the growth of TWB usage and the amount of royalty for all TOWB Music users.

### SPONSORSHIP BATTLE

Provides an innovative program that allows users who need a source of music to host their own battles and actively select their desired audio

The event battle program presented by TOWB Music utilizes the TWB token to resolve the shortage of music and copyright issues by effectively matching the needs between the consumers (sponsors) and the artists.

Consumers (Sponsors) will be offered the chance to select higher quality choices that were judged by unspecified users at a lower cost. Artists will have the chance to debut in the Overground. Sponsorship battles presents a brand-new paradigm that resolves complications like understanding the complexity of copyright issues and restrictive music distribution by 3rd party companies.

## TOWB MUSIC SERVICE

> TOWB Music’s core service what are the Blind Battles?

TOWB Music’s Blind Battle is a new type of competition and music sharing system that offers up-and-coming artists a chance to step out into the spotlight without having to deal with unfair stereotypes. Artists are required to upload 20 seconds of their favored tracks with the names and song titles being randomly generated. Listeners are given the opportunity to listen and pick their favorite tracks to cast a vote. Once the battle concludes, the artist with the most votes will be crowned the winner and entitled to receive prizes. All other participants will have their identity and rankings revealed.

After the battle’s conclusion, the full track will become available on the artists’ profiles and every play on their tracks will be eligible to receive royalty payments. In addition, the artist has the ability to sell their tracks partially or fully to the public where users are able to purchase and receive same privileges as the artists. The consumers are paid automatically via TWB tokens, reliant on the percentage of copyright they own as their works are played.

### BLIND BATTLE

**Blind Battles held by Sponsors**

Blind Battles aren’t limited to being opened by TOWB Music but also available to sponsors (individuals or companies) and able to award prizes to maximize advertising, purchase and use music sources, and holding auditions.
